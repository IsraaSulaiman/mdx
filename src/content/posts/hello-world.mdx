# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post where I'll be sharing my thoughts on technology and development.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Web Development** - React, Next.js, and modern web technologies
- **Programming** - Best practices, tips, and tricks
- **Technology** - Industry trends and insights
- **Personal Projects** - What I'm building and learning

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component to get started:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return (
    <div className="greeting">
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Features

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 14** - For the framework
- **MDX** - For enhanced markdown
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **TypeScript** - For type safety

## Getting Started

To create your own blog post, simply add a markdown file to the `src/content/posts` directory with the following front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
---
```

Then write your content in markdown format!
