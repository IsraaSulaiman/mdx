# Advanced Git Workflows - Beyond the Basics

Git is more than just version control—it's a powerful tool for collaborative development. Let's explore advanced workflows and techniques that will make you a Git power user.

## Git Flow Workflow

Git Flow is a branching model designed for projects with scheduled releases:

### Branch Structure

```bash
# Main branches
main          # Production-ready code
develop       # Integration branch for features

# Supporting branches
feature/*     # New features
release/*     # Preparing releases
hotfix/*      # Critical production fixes
```

### Workflow Commands

```bash
# Initialize Git Flow
git flow init

# Start a new feature
git flow feature start user-authentication
# Creates: feature/user-authentication from develop

# Finish a feature
git flow feature finish user-authentication
# Merges feature into develop and deletes feature branch

# Start a release
git flow release start 1.0.0
# Creates: release/1.0.0 from develop

# Finish a release
git flow release finish 1.0.0
# Merges release into main and develop, creates tag

# Start a hotfix
git flow hotfix start critical-bug
# Creates: hotfix/critical-bug from main

# Finish a hotfix
git flow hotfix finish critical-bug
# Merges hotfix into main and develop, creates tag
```

## Feature Branch Workflow

A simpler alternative to Git Flow:

```bash
# Create feature branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Add user dashboard components"

# Push feature branch
git push origin feature/user-dashboard

# Create pull request on GitHub/GitLab
# After review and approval, merge to main
```

## Advanced Branching Strategies

### Trunk-Based Development

```bash
# Work directly on main with short-lived feature branches
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/quick-fix

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation"

# Rebase on main before merging
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/quick-fix
git rebase main

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/quick-fix
git push origin main
git branch -d feature/quick-fix
```

### Environment-Specific Branches

```bash
# Production branch
main

# Staging branch
staging

# Development branch
develop

# Feature branches
feature/*

# Hotfix branches
hotfix/*
```

## Advanced Git Commands

### Interactive Rebase

```bash
# Interactive rebase to clean up commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# Commands in interactive rebase:
# pick   - use commit as-is
# reword - use commit, but edit commit message
# edit   - use commit, but stop for amending
# squash - use commit, but meld into previous commit
# fixup  - like squash, but discard commit message
# drop   - remove commit

# Example interactive rebase file:
pick f7f3f6d Add user authentication
squash 310154e Fix typo in auth message
pick a5f4a0d Add password validation
```

### Cherry-Picking

```bash
# Apply specific commits to current branch
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>

# Cherry-pick multiple commits
git cherry-pick <commit1> <commit2> <commit3>

# Cherry-pick a range of commits
git cherry-pick <start-commit>..<end-commit>

# Cherry-pick with conflict resolution
git cherry-pick --continue
git cherry-pick --abort
git cherry-pick --skip
```

### Stashing

```bash
# Stash current changes
git stash

# Stash with message
git stash push -m "WIP: user authentication"

# List stashes
git stash list

# Apply most recent stash
git stash pop

# Apply specific stash
git stash apply stash@{1}

# Drop stash
git stash drop stash@{0}

# Clear all stashes
git stash clear
```

## Collaborative Development

### Pull Request Workflow

```bash
# Fork repository (on GitHub/GitLab)
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/project.git

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/project.git

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create pull request
# After review and approval, maintainer merges
```

### Code Review Process

```bash
# Reviewer checks out PR branch
git fetch origin
git checkout -b feature/new-feature origin/feature/new-feature

# Review code and test
# Add review comments on GitHub/GitLab

# Author addresses feedback
git add .
git commit -m "Address review feedback"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Reviewer approves and merges
```

## Advanced Merging Strategies

### Merge vs Rebase

```bash
# Merge (preserves history)
git checkout main
git merge feature/branch
# Creates merge commit

# Rebase (linear history)
git checkout feature/branch
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge feature/branch
# Creates fast-forward merge
```

### Squash Merging

```bash
# Squash all commits into one
git checkout main
git merge --squash feature/branch
git commit -m "Add feature: user authentication"
```

### Three-Way Merge

```bash
# Resolve conflicts manually
git merge feature/branch
# Edit conflicted files
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

## Git Hooks

### Pre-commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Run tests
npm test

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Check for console.log statements
if git diff --cached | grep -i "console.log"; then
  echo "Error: console.log statements found in staged files"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Pre-push Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-push

# Run full test suite
npm run test:full

# Check bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Run security audit
npm audit
```

### Commit Message Hook

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/commit-msg

# Check commit message format
commit_regex='^(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore)(\(.+\))?: .{1,50}'

if ! grep -qE "$commit_regex" "$1"; then
    echo "Error: Invalid commit message format"
    echo "Expected format: type(scope): description"
    echo "Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore"
    exit 1
fi
```

## Git Aliases

### Useful Aliases

```bash
# Add to .gitconfig
[alias]
    # Show commit history
    lg = log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
    
    # Show status
    st = status
    
    # Show last commit
    last = log -1 HEAD
    
    # Show changes in last commit
    last-diff = diff HEAD~1
    
    # Undo last commit
    undo = reset --soft HEAD~1
    
    # Show branch info
    br = branch -v
    
    # Show remote branches
    brr = branch -r
    
    # Show all branches
    bra = branch -a
    
    # Delete merged branches
    cleanup = "!git branch --merged | grep -v '\\*\\|main\\|develop' | xargs -n 1 git branch -d"
    
    # Show file history
    filelog = log --follow
    
    # Show changes in file
    filediff = diff HEAD~1
```

## Git Submodules

### Managing Submodules

```bash
# Add submodule
git submodule add https://github.com/user/repo.git path/to/submodule

# Clone repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Update submodules
git submodule update --remote

# Initialize submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Git Worktree

### Multiple Working Directories

```bash
# Create new worktree
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature/new-feature

# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../feature-branch

# Prune worktrees
git worktree prune
```

## Advanced Git Tools

### Git Bisect

```bash
# Find the commit that introduced a bug
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good v1.0.0

# Test current commit
# If buggy:
git bisect bad
# If working:
git bisect good

# Continue until Git finds the problematic commit
git bisect reset
```

### Git Reflog

```bash
# Show reflog
git reflog

# Recover lost commits
git checkout -b recovery-branch HEAD@{5}

# Reset to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD@{1}
```

### Git Blame

```bash
# Show who changed each line
git blame filename.js

# Show blame for specific lines
git blame -L 10,20 filename.js

# Show blame with context
git blame -C filename.js
```

## Best Practices

### Commit Messages

```bash
# Conventional Commits format
feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication
fix(api): resolve user data fetching issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
style(ui): format code according to style guide
refactor(utils): extract common validation logic
test(auth): add unit tests for login function
chore(deps): update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Branch Naming

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/user-authentication
feature/add-payment-gateway

# Bug fixes
fix/login-validation
fix/api-timeout-issue

# Hotfixes
hotfix/security-vulnerability
hotfix/critical-bug

# Releases
release/v1.2.0
release/v2.0.0
```

### Repository Management

```bash
# Keep main branch clean
# Use feature branches for development
# Require pull requests for merging
# Use code reviews
# Run automated tests
# Maintain clean commit history
# Use meaningful commit messages
# Tag releases
# Document workflows
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

```bash
# Undo last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit and changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Recover deleted branch
git reflog
git checkout -b recovery-branch <commit-hash>

# Fix merge conflicts
git status
# Edit conflicted files
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"

# Clean up repository
git gc
git prune
```
